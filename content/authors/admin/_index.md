I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University working with David Blei. Broadly, I adapt probabilistic models, deep generative models, and embedding methods for causality. I apply causal inference to study political language and debates, social influence, and fairness of machine learning predictors.

I received from PhD in computer science from University of California Santa Cruz and my PhD advisor is Lise Getoor. My thesis research extended structured prediction for understanding social media dialogue, learning causal structures like gene regulatory networks, and discovering model structure. As a graduate student, I interned at Microsoft with the Bing Ads group.
